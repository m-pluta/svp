== Approach

This task seemed quite daunting at first, however I very quickly became fully immersed in this challenge. My approach stemmed entirely from my initial research into the most common methods of solving SVP. The three main approaches

- *Enumeration*
- *Sieving*
- *Voronoi*

== Chosen Algorithm

While all of the above methods are valid ways of solving SVP they each had their own caveats. 
- Enumeration is 

Focus of exactness
